<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I'm an AI Research Engineer working at [Bloomberg AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/artificial-intelligence-ai/). I got my Ph.D. from [Penn State](https://ist.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Vasant G. Honavar](http://faculty.ist.psu.edu/vhonavar/). Before that, I was a research assistant at [AI Lab](https://ailab.ist.psu.edu/index.html). During my master's, I worked with [Dr. Jinlong Hu](https://largeapp.github.io/) at [South China University of Technology](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs_en/). 

My research interests span Longitudinal Data Anlaysis, Natural Language Understanding, Statistical Machine Learning and Information Retrieval. 

I like to have fun and stay fit! I'm into badminton, snowboarding, weight training, math and RTS games! My all-time favorite games are AOE2 and Don't Starve Together.
